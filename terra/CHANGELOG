        - made some cosmetic changes to age_prediction, in case a user's font
          settings are big.

        - changed the path settings for age_prediction, tested this and it 
          appears to work.

        - changed the font to the main window graphic to 'Eras ITC Medium'.

        - cleaned up the code for the topotherm gui, removed all the commented
          out code.  not sure why there was so much commented out code - no more
          clutter now.

        - added an about box to the main window.
        - changed the default directory for the save output file dialog box to ./output/age_prediction
